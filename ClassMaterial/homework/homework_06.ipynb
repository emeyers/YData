    "**Question 3.3 (8 points)** Now let's generalize the function so that it returns a list of statistic values, each calculated separately on one of the group levels in `grouping_array`. So, if 'grouping_array' has *g* different group levels, the returned list should be of length *g*. Note that this is different from the functions we wrote above, where the user specifies which group level the statistic function should be applied to; here, we will apply the statistic function to each of the group levels, instead of just one. \n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, write a function `get_group_statistics(data_array, grouping_array, stat_function = np.mean)`. This function has one fewer argument than `get_statistic_one_group()` since the user does not need to specify which group to calculate a statistic on, because the statistics are calculated for each group. \n",
    "\n",
    "To understand how this function would work, the input `get_group_statistics(earned_incomes, sex, np.mean)` should return a list that contains two values: the mean income for males and the mean income for females. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some hints to solve this problem are: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The `np.unique()` function will be useful to get all unique group levels. \n",
    "2. A for loop could also be useful here.\n",
    "3. Including the function `get_statistics_one_group()` (that you wrote above) in the body of this function will also be useful. \n",
