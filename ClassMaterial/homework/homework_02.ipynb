    "As we also discussed in class, we can use Boolean indexing on higher dimensions ndarray, such as digital images. The code below loads a (slightly older) image of Yale president Peter Salovey. Let's explore Boolean masking and image manipulation on this image to make Salovey's mustache blue. \n",

We will then use this mask to turn the `True` pixel's blue. "
