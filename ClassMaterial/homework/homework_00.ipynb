    "# Homework 0: Running Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this homework is to test whether you are able to run Jupyter Notebooks by either using Google Colabs or through installing Anaconda on your own computer. The only **\"work\"** on this homework is to run all the cells in this notebook. If you have a working Python environment with the `datascience` package installed, you should not see any error messages as you run the cells below. If you do encounter error messages, please try to debug by going to office hours and asking on [Ed Discussion](https://edstem.org/us/courses/30902/discussion/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions for how to install an Anaconda environment with the class packages on your own computer [can be found here](https://yale.instructure.com/courses/84847/pages/installing-anaconda). You can also run Jupyter notebooks using [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) which might be the easiest option. \n",
