    "\n",
    "Paul the Octopus (26 January 2008– 26 October 2010), was a common octopus who was suspected of having psychic abilities. To test Paul’s psychic abilities, workers at the Sea Life Centre in Oberhausen, Germany, assesed whether Paul could predict the winners of the 2010 World Cup soccer games. Before each soccer game, two containers of food (mussels) were lowered into the octopus’ tank. The containers were identical, except for country flags of the opposing teams, one on each container. Whichever container Paul opened was deemed his predicted winner.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the 2010 World Cup, Paul became famous for correctly predicting 11 out of 13 soccer games. We will use hypothesis testing to determine the probability that Paul would get 11 out of 13 correct if he was merely guessing.\n",
