    "**Question b.2 (0 points)**: In order to have all features contribute to the KNN classification, it is useful to standardize the features by transforming them to the same scale. In particular, we can use a \"z-score\" transformation, where each feature is transformed to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. The way this is done is that the mean and standard deviation are learned on the training features, and then these means and standard deviations are used to apply a z-score transformation to both the training and test features. \n",
