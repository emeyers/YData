    "\n",
    "For the past few weeks of class we have been discussing different ways of visualizing data. There are many different theories of what makes a good data visualization, with most of these theories being based on the author's intuition. For example, [Edward Tufte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Tufte) emphasized that the data-ink ratio ratio should be as high as possible. But is there any way to more objectively say whether a visualization is \"good\" along particular dimensions? \n",

    "For this week's quote and reaction, you will read [a research paper by Borkin et al.](https://vcg.seas.harvard.edu/publications/what-makes-a-visualization-memorable/paper) where the authors run a psychophysics experiment to assess what features of a data visualization makes it memorable. While one could argue that memorability might not be the most important property of a visualization, the approach of using psychophysics to more objectively evaluate results is a concept that could be broadly useful in Data Science. \n",
